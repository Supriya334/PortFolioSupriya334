            <p> <b style="color: green; font-size: 24px;">Hello, I'm Supriya, a passionate and dedicated full-stack web developer</b> with a strong educational
                background and a commitment to continuous learning. My journey in education and technology has been
                marked by persistence, determination, and a constant drive to improve and innovate.
                <br>
                I completed my 12th grade from Army Public School, Cantt Kanpur, in 2019. Following this, I pursued a
                BBA degree from CSJMU Kanpur Campus, graduating in 2022. My interest in technology led me to obtain an O
                level certification from Nettech Institute of Technology, which I completed in 2023.
                <br>
                In 2023, I joined the full-stack development course from Prepleaf by Masai. Prior to this, I was part of
                a full-time batch but was terminated due to low scores, as I was new to the field. However, my strong
                determination to learn drove me to join the Prepleaf program to further my education. This experience
                has not only equipped me with comprehensive skills in both frontend and backend technologies but also
                taught me the value of resilience and adaptability. <br> <br>


                <b> Motivation and Goals</b> <br>
                My motivation stems from a deep desire to grow and learn continuously. I am driven by the challenge of
                solving complex problems and developing innovative solutions. My goal is to develop a well-rounded skill
                set that will enable me to become an exceptional engineer in the future. I am confident that with hard
                work, determination, and the blessings of God, I will achieve this goal. <br><br>

                <b> Vision:-</b> <br>
                I envision myself contributing to cutting-edge projects that make a significant impact in the tech
                industry. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and teams to create solutions that are
                not only efficient but also transformative. My aim is to leverage my skills and knowledge to stand out
                in the field and make meaningful contributions to the industry.
            </p>
